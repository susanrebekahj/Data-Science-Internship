# Predictive Modeling
## Objective:
Build a machine learning model to predict an outcome using supervised learning.

## Requirements:
Choose a dataset suitable for classification or regression (e.g., House Price Prediction, Diabetes Prediction).

Use Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

Use Scikit-Learn for model building.

Steps to Follow:
### Data Loading:

Load and explore the dataset using Pandas.

### Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Perform feature encoding (if categorical variables are present).

Scale the data if required.

### Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).

Choose a suitable algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or Logistic Regression).

### Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics like Accuracy, RMSE, or R2 Score.

Visualize the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate plots.

### Optimization:

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
